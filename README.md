# hello-world

Hi humans,

My name is Jose Rodriguez, I am an architect exploring the land of programming I wan to learn how computer science can work with building design. 
Here in my GitHub, I will post all my experiments and exercises, they will be in C, C#, Python. 
Also, I will upload my scripts from Grasshopper and Dynamo where I'll apply all my learnings.
I hope this GitHub can help you with your designs and if you are new in programing as an architect it can encourage you to learn.

See you!
